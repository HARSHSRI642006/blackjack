**Game Overview:**
Blackjack is a card game where the objective is to get a card total closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21. Each player is dealt two cards, and they can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The dealer also draws cards until their total is at least 17.
